Running app: Using `npm run dev`, it's using vite on port 5173, so no need to start a new server to test if it's running correctly. Use the attached terminal to see logs.
Testing front end: Use browser tools to access http://localhost:5173/another_graph_editor/

Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Implement collision avoidance with existing physics
Phase 2: Add adaptive edge length system
Phase 3: Implement clustering forces
Phase 4: Add performance optimizations
Phase 5: Create UI controls for new settings

Expected Results
No Collisions: Nodes maintain minimum distance from each other
Clear Visibility: Ample spacing between all nodes
Natural Clustering: Dense areas form tight clusters, sparse areas spread out
Adaptive Spacing: Edge length varies based on local density
Smooth Animation: Maintains 90 FPS with optimizations
